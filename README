== The Incentosaur ==
The Incentosaur is a ruby application to help you track your online presence via 
RSS Feeds and later commit logs to public urls. The idea is to 
give yourslef points for different things done online such as blog posts
bug reports, comments, and commits. The Incentosaur watches the feeds you tell it about
and keeps your score up to date.

Think of it as Ruby Community: The Game.
